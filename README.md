# Thorium Scroll Tweaker &nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex313031/Thorium-Scroll-Tweaker/main/logo.png" width="48">
A small extension that allows you to tweak the scroll speed on websites.

This small extension allows you to increase scroll speed on web pages either :
- by pressing a key (the *Trigger key*) of your choice: *Left Alt* (the default), *Left Ctrl*, or *Left Shift*.
- or without doing anything: the scroll speed will always be increased, and you'll instead have the ability to *decrease* it temporarily by pressing one of the *Trigger keys* mentioned above.

You can also configure the scroll speed multiplier through the extension's Settings popup.

Tis' quite handy when scrolling through a long web page or large documents quickly!

It is a fork of [this](https://github.com/flawyte/fast-scroll), and was made for my [Thorium Browser](https://thorium.rocks/), as some users wanted faster scrolling speeds on linux.

## Installation

Get it on the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fast-scroll/ecnjcglleblahonnenpaiofkabfakgdi)
